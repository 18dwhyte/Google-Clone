# Google-Clone
A personal project in which I make a clone of the google website


I am using my current knowledge of HTML and CSS to make the front end of the Google webpage.

Improvements I plan to make are: 

- Adding Javascript to the buttons, so that when the user hovers over "I'm feeling Lucky" it'll change to "I'm feeling [insert adverb]"

- Darkening the sides of the buton on hover with Javascript

- Adding a Speech-to-Text API which will mimics Google's microphone feature.

- Changing the Textbar from a rectangle to a more rectange with rounded edges

- Adding a Header
